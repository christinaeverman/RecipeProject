# RecipeProject
The purpose of this project is to gain experience using JavaScript, Node.js and the Google Sheets API. Since I enjoy cooking but find it time-consuming to list the ingredients on a grocery list for new recipes, this project is designed to make it a quick and efficient process for my own personal use. I will extract data from the HTML on a website that I regularly get recipes from, and write it to Google Sheets.

Hopefully after accomplishing my first task above, I will be able to implement more advanced features.
